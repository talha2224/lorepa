                        <p>Lorepa reserves the right to pre-authorize or charge a security deposit to the Renter’s credit card to cover potential damages, theft, delays, or additional charges.</p>
                        <p>The deposit amount varies depending on several factors, such as the trailer’s value, rental type, user behavior, and whether the optional Lorepa insurance is selected.</p>
                        <p>If the Renter chooses the optional Lorepa insurance, the deposit amount is reduced. Without this insurance, a higher deposit is required to cover potential risks. The exact amount is communicated at the time of booking and must be accepted for the rental to be confirmed.</p>
                        <p>Lorepa reserves the right to retain all or part of the deposit in case of damage, breach of these Terms, or unpaid fees. The deposit is generally refunded within 5 to 10 business days after the end of the rental, pending inspection.</p>
                        <p>Owners may also require a security deposit to cover potential damage or loss. The amount is listed in the rental listing.</p>

                        <p>A security deposit may be required for each rental. The exact amount is confirmed upon reservation and may vary depending on the trailer and total rental value.</p>
                        <p>The deposit is temporarily charged or held on the Renter’s payment method at the time of the rental and serves to cover any costs resulting from damage, loss, theft, delay, or other violations of the Terms.</p>

                        <p>If the Renter selects Lorepa’s optional insurance, the required deposit may be reduced. Otherwise, a higher deposit may apply. This policy follows industry standards of platforms such as Turo, Towlos, and Neighbor Trailers.</p>
                        <p>Lorepa may use all or part of the deposit to cover expenses related to any breach of these Terms. Any unused portion of the deposit will be refunded within a reasonable timeframe after the rental, once verification is complete.</p>
                        <h3 className='font-semibold mt-2'>10.3. Insurance and Guarantee Fund</h3>
                        <p>Lorepa offers additional coverage for damage or theft through a guarantee fund accessible via an optional insurance at $10 per rental day. This option can be activated at the time of booking.</p>
