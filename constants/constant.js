  },
  {
    question: "How does the rental process work?",

  },
  {
    question: "Is insurance included in my rental?",
    answer:
      "No. You are required to provide valid auto insurance that covers towing. Additional optional protection may be offered during checkout.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel my booking?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can cancel under the terms described in our cancellation policy. Refunds may vary depending on when the cancellation is made relative to the start date.",
  },

  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a special towing license?",
    answer:
